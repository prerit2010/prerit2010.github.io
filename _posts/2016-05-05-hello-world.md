```python
print 'Hello World!'
```

```java
System.out.println('Hello World!');
```

```c++
cout<<"Hello World!";
```

```c
printf("Hello World!");
```

This is the convention followed by almost every programmer to start learning to code with a simple 'Hello World' program. Every tutorial, and nowadays every blog starts with Hello World. I prefer not to break this convention, and start by writing my first blogpost as 'Hello World!' :)

For quite a long time I had been thinking to start writing blogposts, and had been developing my blog using flask web framework. But laziness or whatever you can say, delayed it. But as quoted by someone :

> Necessity is the mother of invention!

I have finally ended up using Github Pages for my blog.<br/>And the Necessity is:	I need to write my [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project progress as blog posts every 2 weeks :D.

I'll not only be writing about the projects or technical stuffs, but also about my life experiences.  So here we go! ;)
